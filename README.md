# Minecraft BDS Manager
*An unofficial management wrapper for the Microsoft Windows version of the [Minecraft Bedrock Dedicated Server](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/bedrock/) console software from Microsoft and Mojang.*

**BDS Manager** helps the Bedrock Dedicated Server administrator see what server(s) are set up on the local machine with the capability of running multiple instances and versions simultaneously. Some features include:
* Start/stop servers individually or in bulk.
* Send other, miscellaneous commands to a particular server or to all running servers at once.
* Create backups of your server(s) and world(s) manually or through automated routines.
* Manage configuration settings, including whitelists and user permissions.
* Create a new server using the version of the Bedrock Dedicated Server software you want.
* Automatically update the BDS software for your servers in bulk or one-at-a-time.

This project is still very much in the planning stages, so the feature list may change along the way.
